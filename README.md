# Gamebonk
Gameboy Emulator made with c++ and SDL2. 

Requires git submodule init and git submodule update to get dependancies
Put a gameboy rom titled gameboy.gb in the project folder

There are definitely some things I would have done differently if I made this project now. Not having a function to pass in pointers of the components (eg. connectCPU) is one example.
